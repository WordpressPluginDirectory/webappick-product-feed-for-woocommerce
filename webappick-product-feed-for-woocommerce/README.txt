The plugin automatically maps your WooCommerce product data to all Google required attributes including title, description, price, availability, GTIN, brand, and image links.

- Use Yoast SEO or Rank Math data
- Set static values for your entire catalog
- Create dynamic attributes based on conditions

= Can CTX Feed handle large stores with 50,000+ products? =

Absolutely! Unlike plugins that timeout, CTX Feed uses **intelligent batch processing**. Adjust the "Products Per Batch" setting (recommended: 200-500 products) to match your server capacity. This prevents memory limit errors and ensures 100% feed completion for massive catalogs.

= Is CTX Feed ready for Google's March 2026 multi-channel product requirements? =

- Membership products

= How do I sync my feed to TikTok Shop? =

4. Add the feed URL to TikTok Seller Center
5. Set up a scheduled sync for automatic updates

Yes! Use the **Filter** option when creating your feed:
1. Click "Filter" in the feed settings
2. Add condition: "Availability" + "is not" + "out of stock"
3. Generate your filtered feed

Pro tip: Use CTX Feed Pro's advanced filtering for complex conditions.

= Does CTX Feed work with WPML for multilingual feeds? =

Yes. CTX Feed is fully compatible with WPML, Polylang, and TranslatePress. Create separate feeds for each language to target international markets with localized product data.

= How often should I update my product feed? =

We recommend **daily updates** for most stores. CTX Feed's scheduled cron feature can automatically regenerate your feed every 1, 6, 12, or 24 hours. For stores with frequently changing inventory, use the **Auto Update** feature to sync changes immediately.

1. Edit any product
2. Scroll to the "CTX Feed" tab
3. Enter your product identifiers
4. These will automatically be included in your feeds

= Can I create feeds for multiple countries? =

Yes! Create separate feeds for each target country with:

- Region-specific availability

= How do I troubleshoot feed generation errors? =

If your feed fails to generate:
